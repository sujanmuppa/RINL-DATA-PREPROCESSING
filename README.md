# RINL-DATA-PREPROCESSING
This is a Pre-Processing repo about the data obtained 
Firstly Took a Dataset named "1to6.xslx". This is the sample of employees and their tests done at different ages. 
I took the Employee number and age to be the primary key and rest all tests to come as a sub-fields to that
I concluded by uppdating the data set with new dataframe where emp_number, emp_age and all the tests as collumns.
Now onto further analysis..
